## Project Overview and Motive

Blockbuster Movie Rental is a pet project that allows a user to view, add, modify and delete movie catalogues. It's based on the MERN stack.

Being a self-taught developer, we often face the dilemna of 'Tutorial Hell' where all tutorials and courses have solutions as we code along. Through building this pet project, it allows me to sharpen my skills and think outside the box for a real-life scenario where a modern web based solution is required. No more basic Todo Apps and Hello World projects! 

A movie rental app sounds interesting as Blockbuster was one of the major DVD rental companies back in the 90s. As technology improved, the company could not keep up with their outdated business model and companies like Netflix have dominated the entertainment sector. This is a funny spin to the company where they pivot their traditional bricks & mortar catalogue to a modern web based system, instead of an old-school Visual Basic application :)  

## Features

This is a WIP and I will be adding more features and best practices as technology and frameworks evolve. I see this pet project as a blueprint for all my future projects and as a means to demonstrate practical experience to my clients. A few features
- MERN stack - React, MongoDB Atlas, Express and Node
- Unit testing with Jest (WIP)
- React Hooks (WIP)
- Typescript (WIP)
- Bootstrap 4 SCSS framework


## Technology Stack
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Credentials (available on request)
1. You need a `.env` file in the root location of the backend folder in the project for the database connection URL

## Installation (Back-end)

1. The Express server needs to be online first to view the movie and customer details and perform CRUD operations
2. Navigate to `backend` from the project directory
3. run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. run `nodemon server.js` to start the server


## Installation (Front-end)

1. run `npm install` in the root folder
2. The following scripts are available below.

## Available Scripts (Front-end)

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
